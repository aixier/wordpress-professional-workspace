<p>Effective Date: Aug 14, 2025 </p>
<p>This Privacy Notice explains how your personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Petron K.K .Inc,
    operator of the CardPlanet service (&quot;CardPlanet,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).
    This Privacy Notice applies to our websites and our mobile apps for iPhone, Windows or Android mobile devices,
    including the CardPlanet mobile app and the Consulting Services (defined below) (collectively, the
    &quot;Services&quot;). By accessing or using the Services, you signify that you have read and understood our
    collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice and agree
    to our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to,
    describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to
    an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not
    reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.</p>
<ol>
    <li>OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION1. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes we collect personal information automatically when an individual interacts with our Services and sometimes,
    we collect personal information directly from an individual. At times, we may collect personal information about an
    individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction. For example:</p>
<p>Information you provide to us directly. If you choose to create an account or otherwise use the Services, we may
    collect your username (which can be your e-mail address, phone number or Apple ID), password and your gender. We may
    collect personal information, such as your e-mail address when you provide feedback or otherwise communicate with
    us.</p>
<p>Data collected through the use of the Services. We collect information through your use of the Services, information
    about how you use the Services, your actions on the Services, and content you post to the Services, including
    providing feedback through the CardPlanet app and messages sent to and received from Consultants (if applicable) (
    &quot;User Content&quot;). Please remember that CardPlanet may, but has no obligation to, monitor, record, and store
    User Content in order to protect your safety or the safety of other users, to assist with regulatory or law
    enforcement efforts, or to protect and defend our rights and property. By using the Services, you consent to the
    recording, storage and disclosure of such communications.</p>
<p>Location Information. We collect information about the city and country in which you are located, and we may
    approximate your location by your IP Address.</p>
<p>Voice Information. When you interact with us using the voice call feature, we will request access to your microphone
    and recording permissions to collect the voice information you input, which is necessary for the functionality of
    the feature. Please note that if you refuse to grant these permissions, you will be unable to interact with our
    service via voice, thus preventing the normal use of this feature.</p>
<p>Information we receive from third parties. From time to time, we may receive information about you from third parties
    and other users, such as your Apple ID or your billing record. We may also collect information about you that is
    publicly available.</p>
<p>Other information. We may collect additional information if you contact us or otherwise interact with us directly,
    such as by participating in a contest or promotion. We may also collect any communications between you and
    CardPlanet, and you and your Consultant (if applicable), and any other information you provide to CardPlanet.</p>

    <li>THIRD PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING6. </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted
    advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media
    companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so
    that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices
    you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through
    tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and
    similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream
    information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, AdID, precise geolocation and other information. We
    may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising
    partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the
    advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services
    such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties
    (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by
    providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider. Please see “Your
    Choices About Online Ads” below, to learn more about interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>Social Media Widgets and Advertising. Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like”
    button, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect
    information about your visit to our Services, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your
    interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.</p>
<p>We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn
    and other social media forums. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct
    advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform,
    or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may
    share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may
    collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising
    to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy
    policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your
    social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.</p>
<p>Third Party Partners. The following is a sample of the third-party service partners we work with to provide
    advertising services. We will strive to update this list if or when we work with new partners which offer you
    choices about the collection of your information, but as partners change and new technologies become available, this
    list is likely to change over time and may not always reflect our current partners.</p>
<p>Your Choices About Cookies </p>
<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to change the setting of cookies by adjusting
    the settings on your browser to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to
    accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Be aware that
    disabling cookies may negatively affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling
    cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionalities and features of the Services.</p>
<p>Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if
    you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each
    device you actively use. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may
    contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions
    with it.</p>
